# Cyberpolin's Sublime Snippets
A collection of snippets for sublime text.

I hope this collection of snippets will help you saving time and conserving best practices while developing.

So worrie about writing code and not everything else.

## What snippets does it has? How to use them?
- Pseudo Code
-- First of all, the pseudocode snippet, is always a good idea to write pseudocode before star writing actual code, so, what i don't like about it is to write always the same stuff.

## Installing

Just go to terminal and navigate to
``` cd ~/Library/Application Support/Sublime Text 2/Packages/User/```
and clone this project there.

## How to use it?
